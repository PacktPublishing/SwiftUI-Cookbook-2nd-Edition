**A guide to solving the most common problems and learning best practices while building SwiftUI apps**

## What is this book about?
SwiftUI provides an innovative and simple way to build beautiful user interfaces (UIs) for all Apple platforms, right from iOS and macOS through to watchOS and tvOS, using the Swift programming language. In this recipe-based cookbook, you’ll cover the foundations of SwiftUI as well as the new SwiftUI 3 features introduced in iOS 15 and explore a range of essential techniques and concepts that will help you through the development process. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
Explore various layout presentations in SwiftUI such as HStack, VStack, LazyHStack, and LazyVGrid
Create widgets to quickly display relevant content at glance
Get up to speed with drawings in SwiftUI using built-in shapes, custom paths, and polygons
Discover modern animation and transition techniques in SwiftUI
Add user authentication using Firebase and Sign in with Apple
Manage concurrency with Combine and async/await in SwiftUI
Solve the most common SwiftUI problems, such as integrating a MapKit map, unit testing, snapshot testing, and previewing layouts

@State var password = "1234"
@State var someText = "initial text"
var body: some View {
...
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for mobile developers who want to learn SwiftUI as well as experienced iOS developers transitioning from UIkit to SwiftUI. The book assumes knowledge of the Swift programming language. Knowledge of object-oriented design and data structures will be useful but not necessary. You'll also find this book to be a helpful resource if you're looking for reference material regarding the implementation of various features in SwiftUI.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
